    Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. Some causes of the rise in global temperrures include deforestation and carbon emission. The impacts of climate change are already being observed (rising sea levels, wildfires, more frequent and intense heat waves and more).

        <p class="captionTwo">  
    Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns. Deforestation undermines this important carbon sink function. It is estimated that 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the result of deforestation.

    Our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming. Collectively, cars and trucks account for nearly one-fifth of all US emissions, emitting around 24 pounds of carbon dioxide and other global-warming gases for every gallon of gas. About five pounds comes from the extraction, production, and delivery of the fuel, while the great bulk of heat-trapping emissions—more than 19 pounds per gallon—comes right out of a car’s tailpipe.

    To help combat deforestation, you can help the Rainforest-Alliance by buying Rainforest Alliance Certified™ products when shopping for food and beverages, or <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/support">donating</a> money to their organization. The <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/about">Rainforest Alliance</a> is a growing network of farmers, foresters, communities, scientists, governments, environmentalists, and businesses dedicated to conserving biodiversity and ensuring sustainable livelihoods. They are an international non-profit organization working to build strong forests, healthy agricultural landscapes, and thriving communities through creative, pragmatic collaboration. Additionally, to cut carbon emissions, you can bike, ride the bus, or take a train to work instead of driving a car.
